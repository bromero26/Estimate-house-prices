This model is my first attempt at machine learning. In the notebook I built upon what is taught in the Kaggle micro-course listed above and tweaked parameters, functions and exploratory analysis in order to achieve better performance. My goal was to develop a first understanding of key ML concepts and to get interested in moving-up the leaderboard of Kaggle competitions.

It includes iterations with:
- A single decision tree
- Random forests
- XGBoost
